# In  this study case I will analyze the UI/UX for fictional applications. One of the most examples of financial app I found informative and provide good user experience is the page in the following screenshots.

## The purpose of this page is tracking the monthly expenses for the user. Starting from the top of the page the app clearly shows for which period the shown records are, along with the arrow that indicate the user can choose which month they want to display. The number of the remaining many takes the right amount of the screen that is enough to catch the user eye without exaggeration and providing plenty of space for more information. 
-	The progress bar provides good visual representation with more clarification about the money spent and it will be more effective if it changes color as the user nears their spending limits.
-	What can I add to this page to improve the user experience is the option to choose what is the number that is displayed. Is it the remaining amount or spending amount. That is by clicking on “Left button”.

-	The most valuable feature here is categorising the expenses, expecting more categories that covers all the different life aspects when scrolling down.

-	The tabs can be replaced with more meaningful ones. There is no need for the monthly tap, the user can choose to display daily, monthly, or yearly data from an icon beside “October budget”  and I don’t agree with the marketplace button because it diverts focus from budget tracking and clutter the interface.

-	Inside of each category should be the name of the business the money is paid for and the amount of the money without unnecessary complexity. 

-	The green color that is used comfortable for the eye and it enhances the readability and aligns with common financial app aesthetics.

-	This screenshot shows simple straight forward interface that many users who are seeking simplicity, such as older individuals or those new to financial apps would appreciate. On the other hand more advanced features can be included in other sections of the app for users who might appreciate more advanced features and customizations.

## In this screenshot this app covers different goals that a financial app might have from managing users accounts to perform transactions and display the accounts detail. 
-	While the app provides high contrast between the background and the important texts to improve readability, the choice of background color could be more aligned with financial themes. Using that much of different colors doesn’t provide the users with trust and security feelings.
-	The image that is displayed on the main page is descriptive and suitable for goal of the app.
-	The invest page shows the investments that the user enrolled in displayed in cards with a brief and meaningful data about each investment. It provides information about the current investments whether the user gain or losses money. this layout aids in user understanding and decision-making.
-	The layout in Send money page effectively enhance readability and reduce visual clutter. 
-	The “view all” button should navigate to a new page that has all the contacts with search bar at the top as well as the “Select currency” view all button. 
-	The history page clearly displays the income and expenses at the top with different backgrounds to bring the attention to one of them. The feature that should be in this part is displaying the expenses side with high contrast background when the expenses are high.
-	The three buttons to change the way that the data is displayed in the graph is very convenient and user friendly. 
-	The graph is not complicated and many good visual representation for the data by pointing to the expenses amount highlighting it and present the day in bold color.
-	Showing the latest payment serves the user with view all button to add more convenient.
-	In the Transfer page providing analytical information in a card at the top of the page is very useful with a note that the percentage number should be slightly larger and bold to bring the attention. Also, the font that is used should be in larger size to improve the readability for a wide range of users, including those with visual impairments."
-	The avatars in select person section should be replaced with a larger view that display the initial inside instead of the avatar and the full name under the view.
-	Displaying the available cards in card view would be more user friendly if each card displays the available balance under the card number.
## As a conclusion the key elements that makes the app successful are:
-	User-Centric Design
-	Ensure readability and accessibility by maintaining high contrast between text and background
-	Maintaining well organized layout and intuitive navigation
Some obstacles I might face maintaining balance between simplicity for novice users and advanced features for experienced users.
